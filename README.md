# SKIN_DISEASE_DIAGNOSIS
## Skin Disease Diagnosis Model 🌌

Deep Learning Model for Skin Disease Diagnosis 🪟

This project is my endeavor to diagnose skin diseases with considerable accuracy. The model serves various medical and research purposes while also aiming to educate the public on the fascinating science behind skin diseases.

## About 🔍

This repository houses the source code and resources for our Skin Disease Diagnosis Model. The model utilizes deep learning techniques, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with Python. Historical data is processed using CSV formats to achieve accurate predictions.

The model is based on the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model, a type of convolutional neural network. VGG is a popular model for image recognition as it has an architecture that is simple to implement and understand, yet highly effective. The model in this repository uses several layers of convolution and pooling to extract features from the skin images, followed by fully connected layers to perform the final classification.

## Features 📶

- 🤖 Deep Learning Model for Skin Disease Diagnosis
- 🌍 Accurate predictions for medical and research applications
- 📚 Educational resources to understand Skin Diseases
- 📊 Tech Stack: Jupyter Notebook, Python, CSV

## Dataset 🗃️

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). ISIC is an open-source repository of skin images, which is widely used for dermoscopic analysis and skin disease diagnosis.

### Downloading the Dataset 📥

Follow these steps to download the required training and testing images and metadata from the ISIC website:

1. Visit the ISIC Archive.
2. Navigate to the `Datasets` tab on the top of the page.
3. You will see a list of available datasets. Choose the appropriate dataset for your project.
4. Click on the `Download` button next to the dataset. You will be prompted to log in or create an account.
5. After logging in, you can download the images and metadata. The data will be downloaded in a zip file.

After downloading, extract the zip file and place the images in the appropriate directory in your project and run the RESTRUCTURE_THE_IMAGE_FOLDERS.py and then the INPUT_iMAGE_PREPROCESSING files . The metadata will be in CSV format, which can be read using pandas or similar libraries in Python.
